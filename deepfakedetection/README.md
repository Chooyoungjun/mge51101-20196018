kaggle deepfake data 분석 

# Introduction
Nowadays, youtube generates many videos. someone makes fake vidoes and voices for their benefits. and it makes many problems in society. evenif they makes president fake videos. Therefore, it is very important technology. we research fake video detecting algorithm.

Recently, Deep Neural Networks is a paradigm. It solve many difficult problems such as NLP, S2S, Image Detection, Voice Recognition, MOT, GAN. In this paper, We use Two technology Image detection and Voice Recognitio. Because, it can relate with video analysis.

Many researchers publish noticeable papers about the CNN. For example, MTCNN can detect face, Batch normalization can allow to use high learning rate, Inception block can extract complicate feature. To apply CNN algorithm for deepfake detection, we need to answer following questions:
